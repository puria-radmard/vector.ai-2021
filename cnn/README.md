Part 1
- Build a multi-class image classifier on the ​fashion MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model.
- Your library will need to be flexible enough to train an image classifier on a different dataset and be written in a way to allow anyone to use it. We will try to run it internally on our own dataset using instructions you provide. Make it as easy as possible for us to use it.
- Don’t spend too long trying to push the accuracy up.
- Feel free to use open source code / guidelines.
